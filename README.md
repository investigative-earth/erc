# The Environmental Reporting Collective  

Who we are

We are a group of investigative journalists from different continents. Our mission is to collaborate to tell stories of how our societies and economies impact nature. We are committed to producing quality journalism through local reporting and global collaboration and share our experiences to the professional journalism industry.

Some of Asia’s most experienced journalists are on our editorial board. Leading publications in Asia work with us.

What we do

Environmental stories are complex and expensive, but we can’t afford to not cover them. That’s why they require shared research, reporting, editing and distribution. 

- We seek and manage the funding of reporting projects among partnering media. 

- We bring together journalists, newsrooms, and donors from across disciplines and countries.

- We facilitate training, editing and distribution. 

- We experiment with innovative storytelling and share best practices among our media partners.
